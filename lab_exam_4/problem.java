//A Company manufactures Vehicles, which could be a Helicopter, a Car, or a Train depending on the customerâ€™s demand. Each Vehicle instance has a method called move, which prints on the console the nature of movement of the vehicle. For example, the Helicopter Flies in Air, the Car Drives on Road and the Train Runs on Track. Write a program that accepts input from the user on the kind of vehicle the user wants to order, and the system should print out nature of movement. Implement all Java coding best practices to implement this program.
